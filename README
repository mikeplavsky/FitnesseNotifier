The idea is very simple but powerful (kudos to Konstantin Vlasenko!):

Scenario:

You have tests which can't have several running instances. 
You don't want any team member click Test button when test is running.

But now it is possible with Fitnesse :(

Let's fix it!

Easy. 

- First expose Fitnesse page which enumerates all running tests. Format is the same as you see in AddressBar: Product.Suite.BigTest
- Define this page in localStorage for given origin Ctr+Shift+I/LocalStorage/Edit It'll be simplier in later versions! 

Done.

Now when you go to Test URL, this test will be checked against that 'enumurate running tests' page. If Test is being run, button Test will be hidden. 

Enjoy :)
